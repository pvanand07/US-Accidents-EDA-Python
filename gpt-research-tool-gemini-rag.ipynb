Essential libraries like `nltk`, `requests`, `bs4` (BeautifulSoup), and others are imported for text processing and web scraping.\n\n### Define Research Questions:\nThe project aims to analyze Canoo EV's industry, competitors, market trends, and financial performance through a set of predefined research questions.\n\n### Data Gathering:\n- Utilizing Google's Custom Search API to gather data based on generated search queries relevant to the research questions.\n- Scraping web content using BeautifulSoup for detailed analysis.\n\n### Data Processing:\n- Tokenizing and cleaning the scraped data using `nltk`.\n- Organizing data into a structured format (dictionary) for analysis.\n\n### Analysis and Report Generation:\n- Employing generative AI (Gemini model from Google Generative AI) to interpret the gathered data and generate insights.\n- Writing the insights into a markdown file as a comprehensive report.\n\n## Techniques and Libraries Used\n\n- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Used for generating multiple research queries for the user question, processing text data, and summarizing content. Libraries like `nltk` for tokenization and `google.generativeai` for generating content based on questions.\n- **APIs for Data Gathering:** Google's Custom Search API for fetching relevant online links for research queries.\n- **Web Scraping:** Utilizing `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract information from web pages.\n- **Concurrent Processing:** Using `ThreadPoolExecutor` for efficient data gathering and processing.\n- **Qdrant Client:** For leveraging fast embeddings using quantization and semantic search.\n- **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2:** Maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384 dimensional dense vector space.","metadata":{"id":"LzHoN8lS8v5j"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

The company was founded in 2013 by Kyle Vogt, Daniel Kan, and Talmon Hessel, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Cruise is majority-owned by General Motors (GM), which acquired the company in 2016.\n> \n> **Technology**\n> \n> Cruise's autonomous vehicle technology is based on a combination of sensors, cameras, and radar. The sensors collect data about the vehicle's surroundings, which is then processed by the cameras and radar to create a 3D map of the environment. The map is used by the vehicle's software to plan a safe path to its destination.\n> \n> Cruise's autonomous vehicle technology has been tested extensively on public roads. In 2017, the company launched a pilot program in San Francisco that allowed members of the public to ride in self-driving cars. The pilot program was successful, and Cruise has since expanded its testing to other cities, including Phoenix, Arizona; Austin, Texas; and Detroit, Michigan.\n> \n> **Vehicles**\n> \n> Cruise's autonomous vehicle technology is currently being used in two different vehicles: the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the Origin. The Bolt EV is a compact electric car that is used for Cruise's ride-hailing service. The Origin is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle that is being developed for use in commercial fleets.\n> \n> The Origin is a fully autonomous vehicle that does not have a steering wheel or pedals. The vehicle is designed to be safe, comfortable, and efficient. The Origin is also designed to be accessible to people with disabilities.\n> \n> **Business Model**\n> \n> Cruise's business model is based on providing autonomous vehicle ride-hailing services. The company plans to launch its ride-hailing service in San Francisco in 2024. Cruise also plans to offer its autonomous vehicle technology to other companies, such as fleet operators and delivery companies.\n> \n> **Funding**\n> \n> Cruise has raised a total of $14 billion in funding from investors, including GM, Honda, SoftBank Vision Fund, Walmart, and Microsoft. The company's most recent funding round was a $5 billion investment from GM in 2023.\n> \n> **Challenges**\n> \n> Cruise faces a number of challenges, including regulatory hurdles, technical challenges, and public acceptance.\n> \n> **Regulatory hurdles**\n> \n> Cruise must obtain approval from regulators before it can deploy its autonomous vehicles on public roads. The company is currently working with regulators in California, Arizona, Texas, and Michigan to obtain the necessary approvals.\n> \n> **Technical challenges**\n> \n> Cruise's autonomous vehicle technology is still under development. The company is working to improve the safety and reliability of its technology.\n> \n> **Public acceptance**\n> \n> Cruise must convince the public that its autonomous vehicles are safe and reliable. The company is working to build trust with the public through its pilot programs and public relations efforts.\n> \n> **Conclusion**\n> \n> Cruise is a leading company in the development of autonomous vehicle technology. The company has raised a significant amount of funding and is working with regulators to obtain the necessary approvals to deploy its vehicles on public roads.

These challenges include regulatory and safety issues, financial difficulties, and operational setbacks. This report provides a detailed overview of the challenges faced by Cruise, with an emphasis on facts and figures.\n> \n> **Introduction:**\n> \n> Cruise is a self-driving car company majority-owned by GM. The company was founded in 2016 with the goal of developing and deploying autonomous vehicles for commercial use. However, Cruise has faced a number of challenges that have hindered its progress.\n> \n> **Regulatory and Safety Issues:**\n> \n> One of the biggest challenges facing Cruise is the regulatory landscape surrounding autonomous vehicles. Cruise has been involved in several accidents, including a fatal crash in 2022, which have raised concerns about the safety of its technology. As a result, Cruise has been forced to suspend operations in several cities and has come under increased scrutiny from regulators.\n> \n> **Financial Difficulties:**\n> \n> Cruise has also faced financial difficulties. The company has lost over $8 billion since 2016, and it is unclear when it will become profitable. GM has been forced to provide Cruise with significant financial support, which has strained the automaker's own finances.\n> \n> **Operational Setbacks:**\n> \n> In addition to regulatory and financial challenges, Cruise has also faced operational setbacks. The company has struggled to scale up its operations and has had difficulty meeting its production targets. Cruise has also been plagued by technical problems, which have delayed the deployment of its self-driving vehicles.\n> \n> **Specific Examples:**\n> \n> Here are some specific examples of the challenges faced by Cruise:\n> \n> * In October 2022, a Cruise self-driving vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in San Francisco. The accident raised concerns about the safety of Cruise's technology and led to the suspension of its operations in the city.\n> * In 2023, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) suspended Cruise's operating permit after an investigation found that the company had failed to adequately address safety concerns. The DMV also found that Cruise had misled regulators about its technology.\n> * In 2023, Cruise announced that it would lay off 20% of its workforce, or about 900 employees. The layoffs were part of a cost-cutting measure designed to improve the company's financial performance.\n> * In 2024, Cruise announced that it would delay the launch of its commercial robotaxi service until 2025. The delay was due to a number of factors, including regulatory hurdles and technical challenges.\n> \n> **Conclusion:**\n> \n> The challenges facing GM's Cruise division are significant. The company has faced regulatory scrutiny, financial difficulties, and operational setbacks. It is unclear when Cruise will be able to overcome these challenges and become a profitable business. However, GM remains committed to Cruise and believes that the company has the potential to be a major player in the autonomous vehicle market."},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"> # USER: What are the challenges GM Cruise is facing"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"> **The Future of GM Cruise**\n> \n> **Background**\n> \n> Cruise, a self-driving car company majority-owned by General Motors (GM), has faced a series of setbacks in recent years, including regulatory investigations and safety concerns.
