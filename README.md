**US Accidents EDA Project**
============================

Introduction
============

This project involves the analysis of data on US accidents, using Python for data manipulation and exploration. The goal of the project is to gain insights into the causes and characteristics of accidents in the US, and to identify trends and patterns that may be useful for policymakers and other stakeholders.

**Data Source**
---------------

The data for this project was obtained from the [**US-Accidents dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents), which covers 49 states of the USA and includes data on car accidents from February 2016 to December 2021. The dataset was collected in real-time using multiple traffic APIs and currently contains approximately 2.8 million accident records.

**Analysis Methodology**
------------------------

The data was cleaned and analyzed using Python and several libraries, including Pandas and Matplotlib. Exploratory data analysis techniques were used to identify trends and patterns in the data, and to generate visualizations that illustrate the key findings of the project.

**Key Findings**
----------------

Some of the key findings from the analysis include:

*   Accidents are more likely to occur on certain days of the week and at certain times of the day.

*   Weather and road conditions play a significant role in the likelihood and severity of accidents.

*   The type of vehicle involved in the accident is also a factor in the likelihood and severity of the accident.

**Conclusion**
--------------

The analysis of US accidents data using Python has allowed us to gain valuable insights into the causes and characteristics of accidents in the US. These insights can be used by policymakers and other stakeholders to develop strategies for reducing the number and severity of accidents in the future.

**Credits**
